# Golang Client Library for Aeaki Mesh APIs

This go library contains clients that talk to Aeaki resources in a Kubernetes cluster.

## How to get it?

If you are using go1.11+, you can simply use the following command to get the lastest client code:

```sh
go get github.com/aeraki-mesh/client-go@master
```

Or if you need to use a specific version of the client code, you can specify a specific version number. For example:

```sh
go get github.com/aeraki-mesh/client-go@v1.3.0
```

The version number matches with official Aeaki versions for releases 1.3+.
